        <h2> Making sure everyone knows the feel.</h2>
        <p>What do you get when you put a computer scientist, engineer and neuroscientist together? </p>
        <p> A really bizarre cue for a joke and a solution to help bridge a gap in services for kids with autism. </p>
        <p> For individuals with autism spectrum disorders, it can be very challenging to navigate the feelings of others. The ability to identify and respond to emotional cues from other people is integral in forming relationships. Resources already attempt to address this, from behavioural therapy to video modules categorizing various types of emotional responses. </p>
        <p> However, as with many services for mental health, the global demand for services is much greater than supply. </p>
        <p> The waiting lists for behavioural therapy in urban locations extend well over a year. For rural locations, the nearest location to access services may not be easily accessible by public transit. The earlier kids start receiving resources and social skills training, the more effective it is. All of this puts a strain on both the healthcare system and on parents: and that's where our app comes in. Video modules require purchase and are often too time-consuming to rewatch to build mastery.</p>
        <p> Requiring nothing more than an Internet connection, I Know That Feel is a free resource that aims to address these issues. </p>
        <p> The website allows users to learn to identify and mimic emotional responses by playing a game. This is more engaging and interactive than video modules, which may lead to better outcomes for kids. For users, the website is divided into 2 sections: one where children may play the game, 10 short rounds at a time, and one for parents, where they may monitor their children's scores over time. Its easy to read format and reliance on visuals makes it easy to use for children who may be overwhelmed by visual/auditory stimuli or have difficulties reading, and it requires a very short time commitment, with one round having 10 trials of guessing/mimicing a particular emotion.</p>
        <p> With this, we hope to bridge the current gap in the availability and accessibility of autism service and give parents/guardians/educators a new, interactive resource to meet the increasing need to both teach and reinforce emotional awareness for kids--in a fun and novel way! </p>
